        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to our interactive exploration of the climate change effects across the United States. Our project delves into the increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters and the rising costs associated with these events. Through detailed visualizations, we aim to provide a comprehensive view of how climate change is impacting different regions of the country.
        </p>
        <p>
            Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, affecting every corner of the globe. In this project, we focus on the United States, analyzing the widespread effects of climate change through the lens of natural disasters. Our objectives are to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Assess the Distribution of Natural Disasters:</strong> Understand the geographical spread and intensity of various natural disasters across the US.</li>
            <li><strong>Examine Trends Over Time:</strong> Identify whether natural disasters have become more frequent and intense over the past few decades.</li>
            <li><strong>Analyze Economic Impact:</strong> Investigate the financial costs associated with climate-related natural disasters and their trends over time.</li>
            <li><strong>Provide Insights and Visualizations:</strong> Offer clear, interactive visualizations that highlight the significant findings and support informed discussions on climate change mitigation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Our data is sourced from reliable agencies like FEMA, NOAA, and other government databases, ensuring the accuracy and relevance of our analysis. We hope that our visualizations will help users better understand the profound impact of climate change and encourage proactive measures to address this global challenge.
