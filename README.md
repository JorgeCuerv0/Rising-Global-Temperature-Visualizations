	After many years of research, it is common knowledge among scientists that recent climate change is man-made and is likely already causing weather and environment changes across the globe. However, action on climate is arguably not fast enough, due in part to polluting individuals and nations (such as the United States and its citizens) not experiencing as many harmful effects as many other (less polluting) nations. It could be possible to persuade policymakers to take action on this issue by making local effects in the United States more visible.

	We would like to utilize epa.gov climate change indicators data, as well as other public data documenting weather events, to demonstrate that climate change has a potent impact here in the United States. If there is evidence of a local impact, then federal and local interest groups may be more motivated to take action.
